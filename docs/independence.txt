A function is a said to be independent section of <br>
C / C++ code that performs a specific task and <br>
optionally returns a value to the calling program. 
<p>
Functions in C++ are "independent", they cannot <br>
change values of the variables in another function <br>
unless you pass parameters by reference or do some <br>
hacks (which presumably you don't do).
