A <a modularity.txt modular> program consists
of software components that satisfy the following
two properties:
<p> 1. Cohesion: each component performs one
well−defined task.
<p> 2. Independence: each component is as <a
independence.txt independent> as possible from the
others.
<p> Modularity is usually achieved through some
combination of the following:
<p>
procedural abstraction <br>
data abstraction <br>
object−oriented programming
